**GALAPAGOS**

There are two major airports in Ecuador:

José Joaquin de Olmedo International Airport (airport code: GYE) is located in Guayaquil.
Mariscal Sucre International Airport (airport code: UIO) is in the capital city of Quito.
The secondary thing to remember (and this will depend on what island you plan to stay on and/or which one your Galapagos cruise is leaving from) is that there are two major airports in Galapagos:

Seymour Airport (airport code: GPS) is an airport serving the island of Baltra (and connects to Santa Cruz via water taxi and bus).
San Cristóbal Airport (airport code: SCY) is an airport on the island of San Cristóbal. 

Note: Galapagos are expensive as everything has to be flown in.
Note: Most Galapagos tours begin and end in Santa Cruz.

Multi-destination plane ticket in February --
PDX  - GPS 20k points w/3 stopover plus $35 tax. (Note: search by number of points; there are 45k point options with only 2 stopovers)
GPS - LIM 10k miles, 11-24 hours (2 stops), plus $87-114
LIM - PDX 20k miles, 14 hrs (1 stop), plus ~$52 fees
 
Hotels can range from $100-200 a night and can go much higher.

Flights from Guayaquil to Lima, Peru are ~$300 if not paying using points.

**DIY Trips:**

Prices for DIY trips vary greatly, depending on level of hotels an other variables. 
Basic lodging runs around $20 per night at the cheapest, while luxury hotels can be $800 per night or more. 
Meals cost $10-25 per person (more in fancier restaurants), although many restaurants offer a fixed menu meal for $5-10.
Beers are about $5 for a large. Sodas and fruit juice are around $2.50. Batidos (smoothies) cost $3.50 -$5. Cocktails run $7-10.

**Day Tours:**
These run anywhere from about $60 per person on a shared half day tour to a site near town, to about $275 per person for a shared full day yacht tour to a remote uninhabited island.
Public Speedboats (to get from one inhabited island to another) are about $45 per person per way.
No visa fees
**Hostels**
https://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Hotel-Espana/Galapagos-Islands/94446/directions#propname 
3 bed private ensuite runs around $75 per night in Feb
2 bed for $50, 1 bed ensuite for $30
I found the above on hostelworld. 
Seems like there are a few hostels on Isla Santa Cruz and also a cool one on a neighboring island that looks amazing for a bit more. 
https://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Katarma-Hotel-Galapagos/Galapagos-Islands/272600 
2 and 1 bed rooms, 2 bed room = $100, 1 bed for $50 per night
Once you land on this small historical island of Baltra, you ´ll need to head into Puerto Ayora if you do not have a direct connection to your cruise.
The connectivity to Puerto Ayora includes various steps:	1. Bus   2. Ferry   3. Bus or taxi

**BUS:**
Once you have collected your luggage and presented your luggage tag to the staff member at the exit, you need to catch a free bus across the island.  These busses wait outside of the airport, and you´ll be able to follow the other passengers, as this is the only route to town.  You can place your bags under the bus (these spaces fill up quickly), or carry them onto the bus with you.  The bus takes 5 minutes, and drops you off at the Itabaca Channel which flows between Santa Cruz and Baltra.

**FERRY:**
At Itabaca Channel, you take your bags to the ferry, and place them on the roof!  The cost of the ferry is 80 cents US for the crossing, and takes about 10 minutes.  It´s a great opportunity for some first pictures of the Galapagos:  crystal blue waters, lush green foliage, and hot blue skies!

**TAXI OR BUS:**
Once you collect your bags from the ferry roof, there are several options:

A.  Taxi: Taxis on Santa Cruz are white pickup trucks.  The cost of a taxi from the canal to Puerto Ayora is $15.00.  There will be drivers waiting at the dock offering to take you into town.  Make new friends in order to split the cost.   The driver will take you to any destination in town.

A note on Taxis in the Galapagos:​ Taxis are white,  small 4-door pickup trucks. You will ride inside the taxi, and your luggage will go in back. It is common for taxi drivers to pick up locals to ride in the back as you cruise around the islands. 


**PERU**

The Ausangate Rainbow Mountains of Peru 

The Rainbow Mountain trailhead is located a 3-hour drive from Cusco, where day trips have recently grown quite popular.

Advice from my friend that just went!

**Machu Picchu**
See here for costs from Cusco to Machu Picchu by one traveler: https://www.whereverwriter.com/trip-machu-picchu-part-2-breakdown-costs-schedule/ 

Here is the ticket I made to get to Machu Picchu from Aguas Calientes:
https://www.boletomachupicchu.com/testimonios-boleto-machu-picchu/ 

- Flights From Lima to Cusco. The quickest and easiest way to get from Lima to Cusco is by plane. The four largest domestic airlines in Peru, LAN, TACA, StarPerú and Peruvian Airlines, all have regular flights from Lima to Cusco and vice versa.


The flight time from Lima to Cusco is approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes. Ticket prices vary greatly depending on the airline, but expect to pay anywhere between US $90 and US $170 for a one-way ticket. Official taxis from Cusco Airport to the city center are overpriced, so you might want to consider an alternative option.

This is the train you need to take to get from Cusco to Aguas Calientes:
https://www.perurail.com/

About 70% of all people travelling to Machu Picchu will take the train from Ollantaytambo Train Station to Aguas Calientes (1h50m), and then a 40 minutes shuttle bus ride up the mountain to Machu Picchu. From Ollantaytambo Train station, Peru Rail and Inca Rail train operators offer about 15 – 19 daily outbound services (depending on the season) from 6am – 7pm. To get to Ollantaytambo Train Station, you can either travel directly from your hotel in the Sacred Valley (easiest option), or from the city of Cusco. A taxi is the best option for most travellers, but for the budget-minded traveller, a shared colectivo or even local bus costs just a few Soles.

Note: There are only 3 early morning train services from Poroy to Aguas Calientes, operated only by Peru Rail. Take time to understand wet season timetables approximately from mid-December until the end of May

Or: From Cusco you will need to first travel by road to Ollantaytambo Train Station (Sacred Valley), a journey which takes about 2 hours. From Ollantaytambo you can take either Peru Rail or Inka Rail train service to Aguas Calientes. The journey time by train from Ollantaytambo is 1 hour and 50 minutes, and trains operate from 6am to 7pm. There is a ticket office in Ollantaytambo station, but it is better to purchase your tickets well in advance. On arrival in Aguas Calientes, a 40 minutes shuttle bus ride will take you to Machu Picchu.

What a lot of people do is take the train in the early morning (4 hours train ride), stay in Aguas Calientes for the night, and then go very early in the morning (wait in line for the bus to the mountain around 5:30/6am) to Machu Picchu.  The earlier you are there the less people!  There are two other mountains you can hike when you get to Machu Picchu: Huayna and Montana. Huayna is the one Brooks and I did.  It's less steep but takes longer.

I stayed at places that I found on Airbnb but there was this awesome place that my friend told me about where she stayed:  https://wildroverhostels.com/.

I recommend staying near the plaza.  It's beautiful there during the day.

Aguas Calientes is really jam packed with hostels. This is where we stayed: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10249982. Super comfortable and the people are sososo nice.
 

**Other advice from online**
Purchase tickets: http://thriftynomads.com/how-to-buy-machu-picchu-tickets-online/ 
2017 Prices:
Main grounds $47(152 Soles) (Getyourguide: $79 morning, $69 afternoon)
Machu Picchu & Montaña (Mountain): $62 (200 Soles) (Getyourguide: $99)
Machu Picchu, Huayna Picchu & Temple of the Sun: $62 (200 Soles)

As of late, readers have stated they’ve had issues purchasing tickets on the Machu Picchu government website. It seems that the site only accepts Visa cards. While purchasing tickets yourself is the cheapest approach, a hassle-free (albeit pricier) alternative is to buy from a reseller such as GetYourGuide. This provides instant confirmation and is much more user friendly if you are encountering troubles on the government site. You can also consider an affordable guided tour from Aguas Calientes, which includes your bus and entrance ticket.

**Ideas from LIMA**

A Note About Altitude Sickness in Cusco and Machu Picchu
Part of the reason my mom and I stayed in Cusco for so long was to acclimate to the high altitude (11,152 feet), so that we would feel well enough to hike around Machu Picchu. Now, there are many different opinions about this. Since Machu Picchu is located at a lower altitude (7,972 feet), some argue that you should go to Machu Picchu first, so you can gradually acclimate by working your way up to Cusco. It’s really up to you.

For me, it took a full four days before I felt “normal.” I didn’t get altitude sickness that badly, but I did have a throbbing headache, fast heart rate, low blood oxygen level, and dizziness, but I was fine by the time I got to Machu Picchu. To monitor my heart rate and blood oxygen levels (to ensure they didn’t go into “emergency” ranges), I brought a finger pulse oximeter with me. On my second trip to Cusco, I also brought chlorophyll drops, which are said to help prevent altitude sickness.
For more info, check out my detailed post on how I avoided altitude sickness in Cusco and Machu Picchu.

https://www.winerist.com/blog/entry/best-wineries-in-chile-south-america 

Latin America’s largest wine grower, Concha y Toro produces one of the most widely recognized lines in the world, ‘Casillero del Diablo.’ It is one of Chile’s oldest wineries, founded in 1883 by the formidably named Don Melchor Santiago de Concha y Toro. The line named in his honor, Don Melchor, is an outstanding and renowned Cabernet Sauvignon. Visit their winery, located an hour outside of Santiago, for tours and tasting sessions, including a foray into the Casillero del Diablo – the Devil’s Cellar – itself. Budget permitting, try one of their Don Melchor Cabernet Sauvignons for a truly special wine. Distance: 42 km from Santiago

Cousiño Macul is as ancient as it gets by Chilean standards; the winery was founded in 1856, and has the distinction of still being run by the founding family, but it is also home to the first vines ever planted in Chile in 1546. Distance: 14 km from Santiago

Such is Chile’s geography that this boutique winery, at the foot of the Andes, is accessible by Santiago’s metro. It offers views of the towering mountains on the one side, and the city on the other. With a small team, Vinã Aquitania focuses on producing a few wines of high quality. 

The Mano del Desierto is a large-scale sculpture of a hand located in the Atacama Desert in Chile

From Antofagasta, Route 26 or Route 28, both connect to Route 5. The Mano can be found between mile markers 1309 and 1310. It is easy to reach from either direction and can be seen well in advance. If you're going to drive out for a visit, be sure you have sun-screen, plenty of water, and a full tank of gas. Take caution, driving in the seemingly endless salt flats can have a wearying effect and don't let the monotony trick you into driving too fast; too many fatal accidents have occurred in the desert, as evidenced from the dozens of skeletal wrecks and road-side shrines.

Pictures in the Atacama Desert: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/photo-essays/2016-03-09/chile-atacama-desert-travel-guide-san-pedro-hotel-adventure-sights 

San Pedro de Atacama (in Atacama Desert) is a town set on an arid high plateau in the Andes mountains of northeastern Chile. Its dramatic surrounding landscape incorporates desert, salt flats, volcanoes, geysers and hot springs. The Valle de la Luna in the nearby Los Flamencos National Reserve is a lunar-like depression with unusual rock formations, a huge sand dune and pink-streaked mountains.

Note: The Los Flamencos National Reserve is best consumed in chunks. Seven distinct zones over 73,986 hectares (286 square miles) offer different geologic environments, flora, and fauna: Salar de Tara, Salar de Aguas Calientes, Salar de Puisa, Soncor, Aguas de Quelana Lagoon (Salar de Atacama), Moon Valley, Tambillo, and the Miscanti and Miñiques lagoons. The Salar de Atacama is where you’ll find the majority of the flamingos that give the reserve its name.
https://blogpatagonia.australis.com/los-flamencos-national-reserve/ 

You can visit the area under your own steam with a rental car. However, places such as the Salar de Tara are difficult to reach without a guide, so make sure you have a good map if you’re planning on attempting the trip alone.
 
**PATAGONIA**
https://www.alongdustyroads.com/posts/2015/11/28/how-to-get-to-patagonia-puerto-montt-puerto-natales-transport-cost-boat-plane-bus 
 
To reach Chilean Patagonia, you'll most likely fly through Comodoro Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport (SCL)—located about 30 minutes west of Santiago, Chile—and then take a hopper flight to your desired destination. Consider booking a flight to Punta Arenas Airport (PUQ) as Punta Arenas serves as an excellent base for the region's top attractions. 
 
Sky Airlines, Chile’s low-cost provider, flies non-stop between Santiago and both Puerto Natales as well as Punta Arenas for generally lower fares than LATAM. Puerto Natales fares are cheapest when the flight route is published around August each year. From December through March, Sky offers three weekly flights from Santiago to Puerto Natales (fares from $70 online). Two flights to Punta Arenas operate year-round, one direct and one with a layover in Puerto Montt. During the high season, a third flight is added, with fares from $50 online. 
Unfortunately, there are no flights between Puerto Natales or Punta Arenas to El Calafate or Ushuaia.
 
There are several reputable bus companies that connect Puerto Natales and El Calafate, including Buses Fernandez, Buses Sur, Buses Pacheco, Turismo Zaahj, and Cootra. They run daily services that depart between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. The transfer takes five to seven hours, depending on the time spent at customs. Tickets cost from $80 to $130 per person, depending on the service, and can be purchased either online or at the bus station. Book at least one month in advance, especially during high season.
 
 
Ferry services are a hassle-free means of transportation to remote Patagonia destinations and Tierra del Fuego. A variety of boat services operate between Punta Arenas, Porvenir, Puerto Williams (on Isla Navarino), and Ushuaia (Argentina). Cruceros Australis offers three and four-day routes from Punta Arenas to Ushuaia. Tuesday through Sunday, the Crux Australis Transbordadora Austral Brown ferry sails  from Tres Puentes (a port located three miles from Punta Arenas) to Bahía Chilota (a terminal located about three miles from Porvenir). Passenger fares cost 5,500 CLP (roughly $11 USD); vehicle fares cost 34,900 CLP (about $70 USD). Boats depart at 9:00 a.m. Tuesday through Saturday and 9:30 a.m. on Sundays; boats return to Punta Arenas at varying times in the late afternoon and evening depending on weather conditions.
 
There are also numerous multi-day cruise companies operating between Puerto Montt and Puerto Natales. Navimag offers a Patagonian Fjords Route that sails from Puerto Montt to Puerto Natales. The trip takes four days and three nights. Rates vary from $400 to $2,470 USD depending on the season and your selected cabin size. The Evangelistas, one of Navimag's ferries, features 40 crew members, a spacious upper deck, and ocean views from exterior cabins. You'll want to book reservations far in advance if you're planning to visit during January or February
 
Flight: Santiago - Punta Arenas around $50-75 one way in Feb or $100-150 roundtrip.
Bus: Punta Arenas to Puerto Natales (near Torres del Paine National Park) around $12
One good tip is that you can take a shuttle bus directly from the airport in Punta Arenas up to Puerto Natales, so you can get straight to where you need to be and avoid a night’s accommodation cost in Punta Arenas itself.
With a distance of 155-miles (250km) between the two places, the bus from Punta Arenas to Puerto Natales is the easiest and cheapest option. Be aware that with no centralized bus terminal in Punta Arenas, to board the bus, you must instead go directly to the offices of the transport company you are using.
https://blogpatagonia.australis.com/bus-from-punta-arenas-to-puerto-natales/ 
Bus: Two daily buses, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, run from Puerto Natales to Torres del Paine. It's approximately 2 hours from Puerto Natales to the Laguna Amarga ranger station including a rather lengthy rest stop on the way. The buses stop at three places in the park: Laguna Amarga, Pudeto (the location of the catamaran, whose departures correspond with the arrival of the buses), and lastly the park administration center.
$33 entrance fee into the park
 
Note: 
Punta Arenas is close to --
Isla Magdalena and other islands on the Magellan Straits: Home to penguin and sea lion colonies, these islands can be visited by day trips or on cruise ship tours.
The Chilean fjords: The remotest part of Patagonia, the Chilean fjords are home to huge glaciers and pristine, subAntarctic forest. They are only accessible with expedition cruise ship tours. (see below; Navimag cruise)
El Calafate: A three and a half hour bus ride from Puerto Natales brings you to El Calafate, where the great bulk of the impressive Glacier Perito Moreno awaits.
 
 
Navimag cruise to fjords: https://www.navimag.com/en-us/patagonian-fjords-route-puerto-montt-to-puerto-natales-south-of-chile 
For a 4 person cabin it is $450 pp including meals for 4 days, 3 nights to see the fjords. Every Tuesday the ship leaves from Puerto Natales. Every Friday it leaves from Puerto Montt.
What to Pack
Since temperatures can vary between 5 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the course of a single day, it’s crucial that travelers layer clothing. A waterproof jacket and trekking boots are highly essential, as is sunscreen and a pair of quality sunglasses (the sun is extremely bright).
Packing Essentials:
Long thermal underwear that wicks perspiration
Water repellent trekking pants
Light pullover or sweatshirt
Fleece or down liner
Waterproof parka or weatherproof jacket
Hat for sun protection
Sunglasses
Sunscreen
Liner or wind stopper gloves
Waterproof trekking books
Long trekking socks
Neck gaiter
Bug spray
Headlamp
Trekking backpack or day pack
What to do in Chile
Travelers flock to Southern Patagonia to experience the otherworldly beauty of Torres del Paine National Park ($38 entry fee) and spot Patagonia’s wildlife including the Big Five: pumas, llama-like guanacos, South Andean deer known as huemul, Andean condors, and the ostrich-like reah, or Ñandú. There are also flamingoes, foxes, penguins, and more than 100 species of birds. Several tour companies offer multi-day puma-tracking safaris through the park. 
Visitors will also want to explore the park’s old-growth forests. In the canopies of primeval Southern beech trees (Lenga, Coihue, Ñirre) you can spot Magellanic woodpeckers and Austral parakeets.
**TRAVEL TIP**
If you have less than five days to visit Patagonia, the Northern Patagonia/Southern Lakes District may be best as it requires much less travel time than further south which has a five-hour overland transfer and a longer flight. Also, for those who don’t like the often-hefty price tag of trips in Torres del Paine, this region is an awesome alternative with stunning beauty at a much lower cost of travel.
**TIPS**
Borders between Chile and Patagonia closes at 10PM, after that time it is not possible to cross the countries.
It is not possible to cross borders with fruits and sandwiches.
The roads are not so good, if renting a car checks that you have another replacement tire.
Do not wear a snow coat, take several thin layers of clothing, during walks you will fell very hot. Although it is very cold at night.
I don’t recommend Trekking boots, I took mine and I regretted it. Lightweight, comfortable and waterproof sneakers are perfect.
Take a thermos bottle to fill with water, in the hotels there are no plastic bottles and if you do not take yours, you’ll have to buy one there (more expensive).
There’s not a lot of ATMs, so you should always have money with you. You can get money at the airport and in the cities. Credit and debit cards are accepted at all hotels.
In Chile it is nice to leave 10% tip in restaurants. It’s nice to tip the guides or pay a beer!
Watch out for the wind! Patagonia is very windy, always! Be careful when driving because the car runs off the road. Also be careful when you are near cliffs, a surprise gust of wind can end the fun.
Always take sunscreen and USE IT! Even when it is not sunny I’m almost sure you’ll burn! Sunglasses are also important!
In Patagonia crime is almost non-existent. Relax!
The Internet exists in almost all hotels, not always fast. Buying a SIM card is the best option.
In Torres del Paine there is no mobile phone network in some areas of the park.
 
**Tierra del Fuego**
Flight: Santiago - Punta Arenas around $50-75 one way in Feb or $100-150 roundtrip.
Punta Arenas to Porvenir by ferry is around $10 pp and 140 mins
http://www.tabsa.cl/portal/index.php/en/services/54-punta-arenas-porvenir-crossing 
This will get you to the Chilean side of Tierra del Fuego but most people go through the Argentinian side (Ushuaia) so there isn’t much to do near Porvenir. Cheapish to get here but ultimately for what??
 
**BOLIVIA**

Bolivia Salt Flats = Salar de Uyuni 

Depending on where in Bolivia you’re traveling from, you can begin your tour in Uyuni, Tupiza or San Pedro de Atacama:
SALT FLAT TOURS LEAVING FROM UYUNI
The most popular starting point for those traveling from the north of Bolivia to the south
Over 75 tour agencies to choose from
Tours range in length from 1 to 4 days
Salt Flats are visited on the first day, with the tour ending in Uyuni. Most agencies will also offer the option to transfer onto San Pedro de Atacama or Tupiza at the end of the tour for an additional price
Tours tend to be cheaper than the other starting points due to competition driving prices down
Getting To Uyuni
Traveling Between Uyuni And La Paz / Oruro
Traveling Between Uyuni And Sucre / Potosi
Note: Overnight buses from La Paz have you arriving in Uyuni very early in the morning. Because most salt flat tours start around 10am you can technically start your tour the day you arrive. Tours usually finish around 6pm, giving you enough time to take the overnight bus back to La Paz or take a bus onto Potosi/Sucre. If you do not wish to spend the night in Uyuni it’s recommended to book your bus ticket in advance (see booking your bus tickets below)
