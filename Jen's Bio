I am an innovation and creative mindset coach, trainer, and facilitator, deeply passionate about unleashing and nurturing the innate creative power we all have.

I bring people together to create extraordinary things by listening to each other and their customers in new ways.

I bring humanity back to the heart of modern business.

This approach has helped start-ups, small businesses, and large multi-national corporations become more resilient, responsive, collaborative, and creative in the deeply complex and rapidly changing landscape of modern business.

Through helping teams hone their abilities to approach the deeply complex and rapidly changing landscape of modern business through a more human centric lens, I have helped start-ups, small businesses, and large multi-national corporations solve challenging problems by listening to each other and their customers in new ways.

I cultivate an environment of safety and trust in every engagement, allowing for the deep collaboration of everyone involved.
